# UBIS: Unigram Bigram Importance Score for feature extraction and selection using graph of words

It is interesting to note that the importance of uni-grams and bi-grams may contribute more efficiently in determining the feature space vector. In this research work, the Graph of Words (GoW) based selective feature extraction technique is proposed as Uni-gram Bi-gram Importance Score (UBIS) as obtained from node score and edge score in Graph of Words.
